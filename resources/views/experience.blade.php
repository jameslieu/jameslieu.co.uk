                                    I'm one of the early developers working on one of TwentyCI's partner company View My Chain (viewmychain.com)
                                    I'm directly involved with both maintaining their initial prototype product built in Ruby on Rails
                                    as well as the rework of the product which will be API driven built in Laravel and it's web app in Angular2.

                                <p>
                                    Working on the rework involved building and contributing to the API, integrating with
                                    third party applications and consuming this API via the web app built in Angular 2
                                    Maintaining the Rails app involved adding new features, fixing numerous bugs and
                                    vastly improving code coverage.

                                    My primary responsibilities were to develop new features, code review and to deal
                                    with bug fixes for the Rentify platform. I worked on many features both front-end
                                    and back-end including landing pages, emails and interactive web forms. The Rentify
                                    platform is built on the Ruby on Rails framework, uses Rspec for BDD and
                                    Javascript/jQuery for our front-end development; we’ve also experimented with ReactJS.
                                    We employed many other tools such as JIRA, Bugsnag, Salesforce, Chef, CI with Jenkins and
                                    Slack, which enabled us to work in an agile way to release features quickly and efficiently.

                                    projects. This was built in Rails 3 and was my first experience with a relatively
                                    large project. I was also responsible for maintaining another rails project called
                                    ‘Zaypay’ (www.zaypay.com): one of many of mGage’s platforms that enables fast,
                                    flexible and secure mobile payments for digital content and virtual goods. This was
                                    a legacy project built in Rails 2.

                                    Entry was highly selective and I was part of a cohort of seven students who were
                                    personally taught by Evgeny Shadchnev( partner at Forward Labs), and
                                    Enrique Comba Riepenhausen (software craftsman and co-founder at Path11).
                                    We were introduced to the basics of Unix, version control with GIT, Ruby as well
                                    as some exposure to Ruby frameworks such as Sinatra and Ruby on Rails.
